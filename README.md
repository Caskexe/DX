# Yamaha DX7 Soundbanks & Presets

The Yamaha DX7 is an iconic synthesizer, renowned for its unmistakable sounds that have shaped music from the 1980s through today. Whether you're producing retro tracks or exploring the unique FM synthesis that the DX7 offers, these soundbanks and presets are designed to bring the classic Yamaha DX7 experience directly to your setup.

## What's Included

This repository features a collection of instruments and presets converted from both factory and artist cartridges, now available in the following formats:
- **SoundFont (SF2):** High-quality soundbanks that replicate the original DX7 patches as closely as possible.
- **Dx7x**: These files are specifically for importing into Arturia's DX7 software. Please note that not all ROMs have been converted into banks yet, and some presets may not be fully sorted or categorized within the DX7 software at this time.

These soundbanks have been carefully generated using various software processes to maintain the authentic character of the Yamaha DX7. No post-processing or additional editing has been applied, ensuring that the sounds remain true to the original hardware.

## Why Share This?

As a long-time fan of the Yamaha DX series, particularly the DX7, and an enthusiast of the open-source DEXED project, I wanted to share these conversions of SYSX files. Many of these files were sourced from various online archives dedicated to preserving these sounds. Iâ€™ve also contributed to these archives whenever possible, to help keep the legacy of the DX7 alive.
